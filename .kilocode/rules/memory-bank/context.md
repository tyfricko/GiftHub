# Context

*   **Current status:** Multi-wishlist functionality is fully implemented and operational. Profile tab navigation is scaffolded and routed for wishlists, events, friends, and settings. Gift exchange system is fully functional with complete invitation flow, event editing, and secure access controls. Avatar display fixes and auth-based navigation are completed. Homepage logic directs signed-in users with items to profile wishlists, otherwise to a feed page. Email verification UX and gating are implemented: users must verify email before creating/editing wishlist items or managing gift-exchange events, leveraging Laravelâ€™s built-in verification with [class User extends Authenticatable implements MustVerifyEmail](app/Models/User.php:13), custom middleware [public function handle()](app/Http/Middleware/RequireEmailVerification.php:20), and verification routes in [routes/web.php](routes/web.php).

*   **Recent changes:**
    *   **Email Verification UX & Middleware (August 2025):**
        *   Implemented Laravel email verification via [class User extends Authenticatable implements MustVerifyEmail](app/Models/User.php:13).
        *   Added custom middleware [App\Http\Middleware\RequireEmailVerification](app/Http/Middleware/RequireEmailVerification.php) with [public function handle()](app/Http/Middleware/RequireEmailVerification.php:20) to:
            *   Preserve intended URL in session at verification time (stores `url.intended` in [public function handle()](app/Http/Middleware/RequireEmailVerification.php:20) line 26).
            *   Redirect unverified users to home with a friendly warning flash message.
        *   Registered middleware alias `requireVerified` in [protected $middlewareAliases](app/Http/Kernel.php:55) (see line 69).
        *   Added verification routes in [routes/web.php](routes/web.php):
            *   `verification.notice` (GET `/email/verify`) shows [resources/views/auth/verify-email.blade.php](resources/views/auth/verify-email.blade.php).
            *   `verification.verify` fulfills request and redirects to intended URL or `profile.wishlist`, with success flash.
            *   `verification.send` (POST) resends the verification email (throttled).
        *   Enforced verification on key flows with `requireVerified`:
            *   Add/edit/delete wishlist items (e.g., `/add-wish`, `/wish/{wish}/edit`, `/wishlist/{id}`) in [routes/web.php](routes/web.php:58).
            *   Gift-exchange create/edit/invite/assign/destroy routes in [routes/web.php](routes/web.php:96).
        *   UI/UX:
            *   Verification banner component: [resources/views/components/ui/verification-banner.blade.php](resources/views/components/ui/verification-banner.blade.php).
            *   Unverified homepage prompt: [resources/views/homepage-unverified.blade.php](resources/views/homepage-unverified.blade.php).
            *   Enhanced navbar integrated into layout at [x-ui.navbar-enhanced](resources/views/components/layout.blade.php:24); component at [resources/views/components/ui/navbar-enhanced.blade.php](resources/views/components/ui/navbar-enhanced.blade.php).
            *   Flash messages surfaced via notification container in layout ([resources/views/components/layout.blade.php](resources/views/components/layout.blade.php:31)).
    *   **Wishlist Item Delete Bug Fix (August 2025):**
        *   Fixed missing DELETE route for individual wishlist items (`DELETE /wishlist/{id}`)
        *   Updated `WishlistController::destroy()` method to return proper HTML redirects instead of JSON responses
        *   Delete functionality now works correctly with confirmation dialog, item removal, and success messages
    *   **Gift Exchange System (August 2025):**
        *   Complete invitation system with email verification and multi-state user handling
        *   Owner-only event editing functionality with proper authorization
        *   Avatar display fixes in event participant lists
        *   Custom error pages for unauthorized invitation access
        *   Guest invitation pages for non-registered users
        *   Public invitation routes moved outside auth middleware for accessibility
        *   Debugging infrastructure with comprehensive logging
    *   **Data model and migrations:**
        *   `2025_08_07_211044_create_user_wishlists_table.php` created `user_wishlists` with visibility, is_default, sort_order and unique default per user.
        *   `2025_08_07_211131_add_wishlist_reference_to_wishlists_table.php` added `wishlist_id` and `sort_order` to legacy `wishlists` prior to rename.
        *   `2025_08_07_211234_migrate_existing_wishlist_data.php` backfilled default wishlists for all users and linked existing items, then enforced non-null `wishlist_id`.
        *   `2025_08_07_211320_rename_wishlists_to_wishlist_items.php` renamed `wishlists` to `wishlist_items` and added indexes.
        *   `2025_08_08_075630_create_wishlist_item_user_wishlist_pivot_table.php` created pivot `wishlist_item_user_wishlist` with unique constraint and cascade deletes.
        *   `2025_08_08_083525_make_wishlist_id_nullable_in_wishlist_items_table.php` made `wishlist_id` nullable to support many-to-many.
    *   **Models and enums:**
        *   `App/Models/UserWishlist.php` has many items via pivot, casts `visibility` to `App\Enums\WishlistVisibility`, enforces single default per user, includes `public` and `private` scopes.
        *   `App/Models/Wishlist.php` maps to `wishlist_items`, belongsTo `User`, belongsToMany `UserWishlist` via pivot; legacy relationships retained for migration compatibility.
        *   `App/Models/User.php` hasMany `userWishlists` and `wishlistItems`; helpers `getDefaultWishlist` and `getOrCreateDefaultWishlist`; name accessor and mutator.
        *   `App/Enums/WishlistVisibility.php` defines `public` and `private`.
        *   Gift exchange models: `GiftExchangeEvent`, `GiftExchangeParticipant`, `GiftExchangeInvitation`, `GiftAssignment` with proper relationships.
    *   **Controllers and routes:**
        *   `WishlistController` now handles multi-wishlist create and update (attach/sync pivot), image upload precedence, URL normalization and shortening, CRUD for user wishlists, and storing to a specific wishlist.
        *   `UserController` creates a default wishlist on register, exposes tab actions `profileWishlist`, `events`, `friends`, `settings`, and `showCorrectHomepage` routes users appropriately.
        *   `GiftExchangeController` handles complete event lifecycle: creation, editing (owner-only), invitation management, participant handling, and secure access controls.
        *   `routes/web.php` adds named routes for profile tabs, wishlist management routes, gift-exchange routes with proper middleware separation, and email verification routes/guards.
    *   **Views and components:**
        *   `resources/views/add-wish.blade.php` includes multi-select checkbox list of user wishlists with defaults and edit support.
        *   New tab views: `profile-events.blade.php`, `profile-friends.blade.php`, `profile-settings.blade.php`.
        *   Gift exchange views: `gift-exchange.blade.php`, `gift-exchange/show.blade.php`, `gift-exchange/edit.blade.php`, `gift-exchange/invitation.blade.php`, `gift-exchange/invitation-guest.blade.php`, `gift-exchange/invitation-error.blade.php`.
        *   UI components: `components/ui/tabs.blade.php`, `components/ui/wishlist-group-card.blade.php`, `components/ui/wishlist-management-toolbar.blade.php`, `components/ui/verification-banner.blade.php`, `components/ui/navbar-enhanced.blade.php`.
    *   **Services and jobs:**
        *   `MetadataScraperService` used during create/edit.
        *   `ShortUrlService` normalizes and shortens URLs.
        *   `DownloadWishlistImageJob` fetches scraped images when no user upload is present.
