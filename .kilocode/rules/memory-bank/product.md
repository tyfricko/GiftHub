# GiftHub Product Document

## 1. Problem Statement

In many teams and social circles, gift-giving is a cherished tradition that strengthens bonds. However, it can be challenging to select a meaningful gift that the recipient will truly appreciate. This often leads to generic presents or the stress of guessing.

## 2. Solution

GiftHub is a web application that simplifies the gift-giving process by allowing users to create and share wish lists. By providing a central platform for gift preferences, GiftHub helps take the guesswork out of finding the perfect present.

## 3. Core Features

*   **User Authentication:** Users can register and log in to the platform.
*   **Wish List Management:** Authenticated users can create, edit, and delete their own wish lists. They can add items by providing a URL, which the application automatically scrapes for details like name, price, and an image.
*   **Profile Pages:** Each user has a public profile that displays their wish list to other members of the platform.
*   **Gift Exchange Events:** Users can create gift exchange events (e.g., "Secret Santa"), invite others to participate, and manage the event. The system handles the random assignment of gift-givers to receivers.
