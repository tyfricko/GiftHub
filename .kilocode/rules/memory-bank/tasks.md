- [app/Http/Middleware/RequireEmailVerification.php](app/Http/Middleware/RequireEmailVerification.php) — [`public function handle()`](app/Http/Middleware/RequireEmailVerification.php:20) stores intended URL (`url.intended`) and redirects unverified users with a warning.

  - [`'verified' => EnsureEmailIsVerified::class`](app/Http/Kernel.php:67)

  - Notice (GET) [`/email/verify`](routes/web.php:32-35) → [resources/views/auth/verify-email.blade.php](resources/views/auth/verify-email.blade.php)
  - Verify (GET) [`/email/verify/{id}/{hash}`](routes/web.php:36-48) fulfills request and redirects to `session('url.intended')` if present, else to `profile.wishlist`
  - Resend (POST) [`/email/verification-notification`](routes/web.php:50-53) with throttle
  - Gated flows using `requireVerified`:
    - Wishlist: [`/add-wish` + edit/delete](routes/web.php:58-67)
    - Gift-exchange: create/edit/invite/assign/destroy ([routes/web.php:96-104](routes/web.php:96), [routes/web.php:106-108](routes/web.php:106))

**Key Improvements:**
- Enforced verification for critical actions via custom `requireVerified` middleware while keeping public invitation routes accessible.
- Preserved intended URLs so users return to their original action after verifying.
- Clear UX: banner, notice page, and unverified homepage with resend options.
- Consistent flash messaging surfaced in a global notification container.
- Friendly success redirects after verification with success feedback.
## Upcoming Tasks


### Phase 2: Enhanced Navigation Tabs
**Priority:** Medium

    following_id INT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (follower_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (following_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    UNIQUE KEY unique_follow (follower_id, following_id)
