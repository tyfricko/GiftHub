## Architecture Highlights

### Design System Principles
1. **Modern & Clean**: Emphasis on whitespace, clear typography, and uncluttered layouts
2. **Accessible**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with proper contrast ratios and keyboard navigation
3. **Consistent**: Unified visual language across all components and pages
4. **Scalable**: Reusable components and design tokens that grow with the application
5. **User-Centric**: Intuitive navigation and clear visual hierarchy

### Component System
- **18+ Core Components**: From basic buttons to complex modals and data tables
- **Variant Architecture**: Consistent variant system (primary, secondary, ghost, etc.)
- **Size System**: Standardized sizing (xs, sm, md, lg, xl) across all components
- **State Management**: Comprehensive state handling (default, hover, focus, disabled, loading)
- **Responsive Behavior**: Mobile-first design with consistent breakpoint behavior

### Color System Enhancement
- **Primary Green Scale**: 10-step scale from #F0FDF4 to #14532D
- **Accent Blue Scale**: 10-step scale from #EFF6FF to #1E3A8A  
- **Neutral Gray Scale**: 10-step scale from #F8FAFC to #0F172A
- **Semantic Colors**: Success, warning, error, and info variants
- **Accessibility Compliance**: All color combinations meet WCAG contrast requirements

### Typography System
- **Font Family**: Inter with Source Sans Pro fallback
- **Scale**: 10-level typography scale from caption (12px) to display-lg (56px)
- **Weight System**: 5 weight levels (400, 500, 600, 700, 800)
- **Line Height**: Optimized line heights for readability
- **Responsive Scaling**: Automatic scaling across breakpoints
