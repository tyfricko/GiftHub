# GiftHub â€“ Technical Implementation Strategy

## 1. CSS Framework Migration

**Recommendation:**  
- Migrate from Bootstrap 4 to [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility-first, modern, and highly customizable styling.
- Tailwind enables rapid prototyping, consistent spacing, and easy theming (including dark mode support).
- Remove Bootstrap CSS/JS and related classes from Blade templates.

**Steps:**
1. Install Tailwind CSS via npm and configure with Laravel Mix/Vite.
2. Replace Bootstrap classes in Blade files with Tailwind utility classes.
3. Move custom styles from `public/main.css` to Tailwind's `@layer` directives or as needed.
4. Use Tailwind plugins for forms, typography, and accessibility.
5. Test all screens for visual and functional parity.

## 2. Blade Component Integration

- Refactor UI elements into Blade components (e.g., `resources/views/components/ui/`).
- Each component (Button, Card, Navbar, etc.) should encapsulate markup and styling.
- Use [Laravel's slot and attribute system](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/blade#components) for flexibility.
- Example usage:
  ```blade
  <x-ui.button type="primary">Create Exchange</x-ui.button>
  <x-ui.card>
    <x-slot name="title">Birthday Wishlist</x-slot>
    ...
  </x-ui.card>
  ```

## 3. Asset Management

- Use Laravel Mix/Vite for compiling Tailwind and JS assets.
- Optimize images and SVGs for avatars, icons, and illustrations.
- Store design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) in Tailwind config for consistency.

## 4. Accessibility & Testing

- Use [axe-core](https://www.deque.com/axe/) or [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) to audit accessibility.
- Write feature tests for critical user flows (gift exchange, wishlist management).
- Ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

## 5. Rollout Strategy

- Implement redesign in a feature branch.
- Use feature flags or staged rollout for major UI changes.
- Gather user feedback and iterate before full deployment.
